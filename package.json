    "description": "Amazon Relational Database Service  \n\nAmazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it\neasier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It\nprovides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational\ndatabase and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers\nto focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.\n\nAmazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL,\nMicrosoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon Aurora database server. These\ncapabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today\nwith your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon\nRDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software\nthat powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB\ninstance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's\ndemand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and\nyou pay only for the resources you use.\n\nThis interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming\nor command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Note that Amazon RDS\nis asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such\nas polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied.\nIn this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is\napplied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance\nwindow. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some\nrelated topics from the user guide.\n\n Amazon RDS API Reference \n\n *  For the alphabetical list of API actions, see API Actions\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html]\n   .\n   \n   \n *  For the alphabetical list of data types, see Data Types\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html].\n   \n   \n *  For a list of common query parameters, see Common Parameters\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html]\n   .\n   \n   \n *  For descriptions of the error codes, see Common Errors\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html]\n   .\n   \n   \n\n Amazon RDS User Guide \n\n *  For a summary of the Amazon RDS interfaces, see Available RDS Interfaces\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html#Welcome.Interfaces]\n   .\n   \n   \n *  For more information about how to use the Query API, see Using the Query API\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Using_the_Query_API.html]\n   .",
